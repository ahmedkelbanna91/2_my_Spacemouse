# 2_my_Spacemouse
  This ia the best and most interesting project I have been working on. It is a combination of reverse engineering, modification and development of the Spacemouse from 3Dconnexion. I designed the body and this is the code that reads all data from sensors and buttons then send it to the 3DxWare software to use it as same as the original spacemouse compact.

  It is based on Waveshare Esp32S3 Zero board.
